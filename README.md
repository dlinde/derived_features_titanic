## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used Kaggle's Titanic Dataset to understand:

1. What factors explain who lived and died on the ship?
2. How decision trees can reveal how those factors interact
3. How we can convert those insights into features that are legible to other estimators

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The code is commented to show my thought process for each step.  

There is an additional `.png` file showing a decision tree fit on titanic data. And a `.csv` with titanic data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

My findings are available [here](https://medium.com/@dimitrilinde/parsing-nonlinear-relationships-and-deriving-features-with-titanic-data-20b29328c45b).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  Otherwise, use the code here as you would like!
